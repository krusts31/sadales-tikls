Here is a source code that I use for my wordpress clients

```bash
make up-dev
```

##### Step 1
Set up .env-dev
##### Step 2
add your host name to /etc/hosts
```bash
#if you are using NAT
echo "127.0.0.1     your-domain.what-ever" >> /etc/hosts
#if you are using Bridge 
echo "IP.OF.YOUR.VM     your-domain.what-ever" >> /etc/hosts
```
##### Step 3
configu nginx to match your-domain.what-ever"
